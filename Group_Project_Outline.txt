Group Project Presentation Outline
	
	• Project Introduction
		○ Airline Delays In Current Events
		○ Motivation - predict delays for airports
	• Data Introduction
		○ Source Information
		○ Focus on total flights/ total delays for all airlines
		○ One airport (ORD)
	• Data Overview
		○ Plots of Data / ACF / PACF
		○ Data Characteristics (MULT / ADD / SEASONALITY)
		○ KPSS Test for normality
		○ Differencing
		○ Box Cox Transformation
	• Simple Models
		○ Holt Winters
		○ Seasonal Naïve
		○ Issue with these models -> delays are a function of flights
	• Arima Model
		○ EACF
		○ Auto.Arima
		○ Better prediction but still 'shock' of post covid flight increases
	• VAR/ARIMA w XREF/etc
	• Interruption model?
	• Conclusion
		○ The incorporation of total_flights as a predictor improved the fit
Potential for more predictors to be incorporated like weather forecast, airline operations
